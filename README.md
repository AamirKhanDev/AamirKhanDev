## Skills 

#### Attention to detail
- I’ve always had a keen eye for detail and it played a crucial role in my previous career as an accountant 
- One of our main tasks every month was to produce a month end report. This required a lot of co ordination with other team members and adhearing to a strict deadline while simultaneously checking figures ensuring everything is met to the standards set by law. Keeping an eye out for small minute errors upon 10000's of figures heightened my ability to pick up on small details.
- My ability to pick up on precise detail transferred excellently into programming and my journey through Makers. During my pairing sessions, I would often solve blockers by spotting innaccuracies in our code and overcoming errors, allowing us to progress further through the research materials.
- This skill also became very useful in code refactoring tasks. I'm often able to quickly identify code that is not efficient and able to streamline it accordingly while maintaining full functionality and making future implementation of features much simpler. 

#### Problem solving
- My competitive nature and logical mind mean that problem solving comes very naturally to me. My drive to compete and be the best that I can be, have proved to be valuable traits in my transition into the tech industry
- My previous employment gave me a lot of opportunities to problem solve. The company faced an issue where a project required multiple members of the team working simultaneously on a different data sets simultaneously. Using my Excel ability, I designed a spreadsheet that would allow for a vast amount of data to be imported and analysed by multiple members of the research team, all compiled into one master spreadsheet. The analysed data would then be quantified in sync on a different tab, allowing for a streamlined data analysis process, catered to the needs of the end user.
- After starting at Makers, I soon realised that problem solving is the continuous theme of everything technological. Programs are built to solve a problem. To build a program, a set of problems and errors must be overcome. My enjoyment of solving these problems is one of my main drivers to continue to learn about software. 

#### Ability to learn / curious mind
- Over the past year, I've developed a keen interest creating simple applications and then progressively increasing its complexity. An example is a Rock, paper and scissors game. Initially I created it with the intention of it working only in the command line. Later once I developed my HTML,CSS and Javascript skills, I updated it from a command line game into an interactive web game with clickable buttons. Further adding to this I added a scoreboard and made it much more aesthetically pleasing.
- Always had a passion to know how things work. During my time in Accounting & Finance, I developed my Excel and VBA skills significantly and purely of my own volition in order to better manage project data and automate tedious tasks. I swiftly became the office’s ‘Excel guy’ and was often brought on to various projects that required data handling purely for my Excel/VBA ability.
- My tendency to want to figure things out became very useful during Makers. Due to the intense nature of the course, we would often only broach certain subjects briefly but my curiosity would always drive me to continue to work into the evenings and during the weekends to ensure I thoroughly understood some of the trickier concepts.

#### Emotional Intelligence / Communication
- Having worked in many different industries during my time in Accounting & Finance I have had the priviledge to work with many different individuals. That includes people with different work ethics, different mindsets, different abilities and different communicative styles. This has enabled me to learn to adapt to nearly any situation and have empathy toward my peers or co workers during tough situations. This was further higlighted at my time at Makers Academy as I progressed through the bootcamp. There were times that I had to pair program with peers who were above and below my skill level and what assisted greatly was my ability to communicate constantly with what concepts I was comfortable with and was uncomfortable with. I also aim to listen to any criticism or concerns from my peers and support them if required and show patience with their learning and development.

#### Team player + Leadership
- My communication and team playing skills thrived throughout my time at Makers Bootcamp, enabling me to work well with others and providing a great dynamic to the group. While creating our Project 'Acebook', I ensured that we met the given Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and user stories by always focusing back to these, keeping the customer at the heart of the project and ensuring as a team everyone had an equal say in what tickets they wanted to tackle while creating the project.
